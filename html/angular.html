                    The only of the many Front-end Frameworks in 2023 based on TypeScript, Angular makes its spot on
                    this list. Angular
                    was initially released in the year 2010 by Google as AngularJs. The now known version of the
                    Framework (Angular 2+)
                    was developed and deployed in 2016, keeping in mind the need for improved technology to overcome the
                    hurdles faced
                    by the conventional Frameworks. Similar to ReactJs, it is an open-source platform used to develop
                    user interfaces on
                    the front end.

                    The one main difference between React and Angular is that Angular has a two-way binding feature. The
                    presence of
                    this feature allows the integration of any changes made in the model with the view. This way, a
                    developer would see
                    what changes they are making in the application and how it looks in real-time.

                    Angular usually deals with the development of mobile and web applications. Not just that, but one
                    can easily build
                    both single and multi-page web applications. Due to its various features, Angular is opted by some
                    of the biggest
                    companies in the world, including Microsoft Office, BMW, Forbes, Gmail, and Upwork.

                    Although Angular has better features when compared to React, it is not easy to learn. The framework
                    is a bit complex
                    and thus takes time to excel at.

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Advantages</h4>

                    The in-built functionality of this framework allows real-time model-view synchronization and makes
                    it easier to make
                    any changes to the application.
                    The presence of Directives allows the developers to play around with the Document Object Model (DOM)
                    and create rich
                    content using HTML.
                    Dependency injectors allow the developers to decouple interdependent components of code and reuse
                    these components
                    however they need.
                    Angular gained popularity among the developers since it was launched. Today, there’s a big community
                    of web
                    developers who use Angular. A developer can easily seek help from this community if he faces an
                    issue.

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Limitations</h4>

                    The wide variety of features and built-in functionalities make Angular a very complex language to
                    learn.
                    Dynamic applications can lag sometimes and may not perform upto the mark.
                    Applications
                    Angular is the go-to option for most enterprise-based and dynamic web applications due to its
                    two-way data binding
                    that allows browser-based applications to augment.

                    <h4 class="fw-bold">When Can you not use Angular</h4>

                    Angular is the complete dynamic solution as a Framework. Thus, if you want to build small-scale web
                    applications,
                    you may not want to opt for angular because you would not utilize its resources to the best. It
                    would merely be a
                    misuse of time and resources. Furthermore, if you are a new developer with a small team, you should
                    avoid using the
                    complex Frameworks like Angular.
